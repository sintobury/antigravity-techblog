Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

## Main Features

### Routing
A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

### Rendering
Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components.

### Data Fetching
Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components.

## Why Next.js?

It handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

### Developer Experience
Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with features like Fast Refresh and TypeScript support out of the box.

### Performance
Automatic image optimization, font optimization, and script optimization help ensure your application is fast by default.
